# Welcome to Python Bootcamp Data Analysis for Beginners
 
## Bootcamp description
In this bootcamp we get you started with Python programming. The first two lessons will cover Python basics, starting from the 3rd lesson we will be moving towards pandas for data analysis. 

After finishing this bootcamp you will:
* understand high-level code in general
* know a bit how your computer and its file system works
